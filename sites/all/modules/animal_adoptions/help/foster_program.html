<h2>Clarenville Area SPCA <span>Foster Program</span></h2>
<p>Our Foster Program allows eligible animals to be housed with loving families within the community.</p>
<p>When you enter an animal into the Foster Program, you permit your website users to apply to foster this animal through the foster application process.</p>
<h3>The Foster Application Process</h3>
<p>From the animal profile page, select the Foster Program checkbox and save.</p>

<p>Once an animal has been entered into the Foster Program, a "Foster" button will appear in their profile.  This will allow for a registered user to apply to foster this animal.</p>

<p>When this foster button is pressed, the website will ask the user to login to their account if they are not already logged in.  Once logged in, the user will be presented with a foster application similar to the following.  The available user information is pre-populated based on the user account details.  If the user has applied to foster an animal in the past using this form, the data entered from that application will also be pre-populated in this form.  The user can then update their information if it has changed.</p>

<p>Once a user has submitted the foster application form, three things occur:
<ul><li>The application gets saved to the website for processing</li>
<li>A "thank you" email is sent to the user who submitted the application</li>
<li>A "notify" email is sent to the email recipients who are registered to receive this notification</li></ul>
The user is then free to navigate around the website normally.</p>
<p>To administer a foster application that has been submitted by a user, see <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/foster_requests">Foster Requests Overview</a></p>
