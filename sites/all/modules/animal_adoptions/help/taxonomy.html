<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Taxonomy are terms that are grouped into something called vocabularies. For example, a vocabulary called "Fruit" would contain the terms "Apple" and "Banana".</p>
<p>Each dropdown menu on your website contains a list of vocabularies that can be accessed here.  You can add, edit or delete vocabularies and their terms.  This becomes useful for fine tuning these items.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, The vocabulary "Cat Breed" has the terms "American Shorthair", "Siamese", "Persian", and so on.  If you want to add more cat breeds, just click the "add terms" link in the "Cat Breed" Vocabulary and add the name.</p>
