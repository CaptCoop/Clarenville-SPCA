<h2>Veterinarian <span>Office</span></h2>
<p>Veterinarians often are needed to treat some of our animals when their health is in question.  When you add a new Animal Profile, you are prompted to indicate what Veterinarian Office deals with this animal.  All the Veterinarian details are entered here, including what Doctors work at that Office.</p>
<p>Although Veterniarin Offices are not mandatory details, there may be times when it is required.</p>
