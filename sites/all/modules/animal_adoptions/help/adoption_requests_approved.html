<h3>Approve an Adoption Request - <span>Print Contract</span></h3>
<p>Once you have approved an adoption contract and the user is ready to pick up their animal, you'll need to print the adoption contract for them to sign.</p>
<p>Under the "Application" tab near the bottom of the application, you'll see a "Preview Contract" button.  Click this, and a new window will open with all the contract details pre-populated with the information currently available.</p>
<p>Most of the important information will display as bolded.  Other information such as weather or not the animal is a dog or cat, also gets pre-populated (in plain text) where required.  Take some time to review all the populated information for accuracy, especially information about the user located below the "Disclaimer".</p>
<p>As all the user information is pulled from the user account, if any mistakes exist here, they can only be corrected by editing the information in the user account.  This can be done by either having the user correct this information themselves (preferred), or you can access the user account yourself to correct these mistakes.  See the help file <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/edit_user">Edit User Accounts</a> for more detail.</p>
<p>If all the information on the contract is correct, then click the "Print" link at the top of the contract.  This will open a new window with the contract to be printed, then your printer options will open.  Select your printer options then print.</p>
<p>Once the contract has been printed, close the window then close the file.  See the help file <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/close_contract">Closing an Adoption Application</a> for more info.</p>
