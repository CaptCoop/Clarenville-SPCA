<h2>Animal Requests <span>Overview</span></h2>
<p>Located at the bottom of the ADOPT A PET page, is the form a user will fill out to submit a request for an animal that is not in the shelter.</p>
<p>Requests are made by selecting from several dropdown boxes and radio buttons, the parameters you are looking for in an animal.  The fields, Category, Breed, Hair Type and Size are all pulled from information that has already been entered into the system.</p>
<p>When a user makes a request, the request is saved to the database and a thank-you email is sent to the users contact email they had provided.</p>
<p>Requests are searched against the database of registered animals each time you access this menu item.  Matches are scored on a point system that assigns a certain number of points against each submitted parameter the user had entered.  If the animal is a close match to what was requested, then the resulting animal will be added to the animal request table and displayed to the screen.</p>
<p>The Request table is laid out as follows:</p>

<p><ul><li><strong>1</strong> These are the names of the animals that matched the users request.  Click on a name and you'll open that animal profile in a new window.</li>
<li><strong>2</strong> All animal requests are ordered by ID.  To select a request to view, select the ID number of the request here.</li>
<li><strong>3</strong> Once you have selected a application ID to view, you will be presented with request parameters.  This is what the user had requested in an animal.  You can compare the matched animals profile to the requested parameters to see if the animal is a good match or not.</li>
<li><strong>4</strong> Application Status & Notes.  Application Status can be Waiting, Contacted, In Review or Closed.  The notes section works the same as all other notes section.</li></ul></p>
