<h2>Animal <span>Profile</span></h2>
<p>An animal profile contains all the information you have available on any animal in the shelter.  It can contain simple information such as name and age, to more complex information such as medical history and information.</p>
<p>When you add an animal profile, you can control where it appears on the site (pet of the week, adopted, etc) based on the selections you make here.</p>
<p>When  profile is complete, it is displayed to the website in several different forms, as can be seen below.</p>

<p>The main profile that is displayed above, shows information displayed in two different formats.  <ul><li>The dark grey bullets that have the images in them, displays the data that anyone can see.</li>  <li>The italicized items below them are only visible to staff who are logged into the site and cannot be accessed by anyone without staff privileges.</li></ul></p>
