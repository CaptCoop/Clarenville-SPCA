<h2>Administer an Adoption <span>Request</span></h2>
<p>Any new applications that arrive into the system will be automatically marked with a application status of "Waiting".  All waiting applications are new applications that have not been administered yet.</p>

<p>Once a decision has been made on the file, you should change the assign status to reflect that decision (Approved/Rejected), make any required notes, and save.</p>
<p>If the application was approved, then once the user has picked up their adopted animal. Capture this activity in the notes section, then change the assigned status to Closed.</p>
