<h2>Blog <span>Entry</span></h2>
<p>A blog entry can cover four different categories;
<ul><li>Recent News</li>
<li>Second Chance Stories</li>
<li>SPCA Merchandise</li>
<li>Thrift Store</li></ul></p>
<p>Each blog post gets sorted and displayed on the website in the proper category of the blog category in question.</p>
<p>Need to add some information on some thrift store items?  Make a blog entry under the category of "Thrift Store" and your story will be instantly posted to the website with all the other Thrift Store items.  The same is for all the other categories.</p>
<h3>Front <span>Page</span></h3>
<p>If you go to the menu item called "What's New", you will see a dropdown of five different selections.</p>
<img src="path:images/Blog/B_menu-selection.png" />

<p>The menu item marked <strong>"Front"</strong>, is the home page of the blog.  This page displays <strong>all</strong> blog stories from all categories, and is ordered by priority.  If you want a story to display on this page, then you must set the priority for that story.  See the help file <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/add_blog_entry">Add New Blog Entry</a> for more information on blog priorities.</p>
