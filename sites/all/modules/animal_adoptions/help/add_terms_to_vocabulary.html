<h2>Add Terms To a <span>Vocabulary</span></h2>
<p>To add additional terms to a vocabulary, do the following:</p>
<p><ul><li>From the <em>Management Navigation Bar</em>, go to Structure > Taxonomy</li>
<li>Click the <span>list terms</span> link on the vocabulary name you want to add more terms to.  This will display all the current terms in the vocabulary name, and give you the option to add more terms to the list</li>
<li>Click the <span>ADD TERM</span> button</li>
<li>Add the name of the new term and save</li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>.  The name of the term you want to add</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>.  An administrative description of the term being added</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p><strong>Parent terms</strong>.  If the term you are adding is a sub-term of an already existing term, you can set that attribute here.  Using the drag-and-drop handles under the <span>list terms</span> link does the same thing.  For example:  A Vocabulary called "Automobile Manufactures" has the terms "Honda", "Toyota", "Ford", "BMW", etc.  These terms could then have sub-terms that are the models each automobile manufacture. Honda would have sub-terms, "Civic", "Accord", "CR-V", etc.  Ford could have the terms "Focus", "Mustang", "F-Series Trucks", etc.  This principle can also be applied recursively.  For example, the sub-term "F-Series Trucks", could have further sub-terms "F-150", "F-250", "F-350", etc.</p>
<p><strong>Weight</strong>. Where in the list this term is listed.  Higher numbers sink to the bottom.</p>
