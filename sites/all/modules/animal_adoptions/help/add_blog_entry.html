<h2>Add New Blog <span>Entry</span></h2>
<p>To add a new Blog entry, follow the following steps:
<ul><li>In the Staff navigation bar, (black navigation bar that goes across the top of the entire screen when you are logged in), go to Content > Add Content > Blog Entry</li>
<li>You will then be presented with the Create Blog Entry page where you can create your blog entry.</li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>.  This is the title of the blog post.</p>
<p><strong>Media Type</strong>.  Here, you will select whether you are adding in a video or picture of the animal in question.  Although you can add both, it is not recommended as it may interfere with certain layouts and site views.</p>
<p><strong>Image</strong>.  Click the "choose file" button to select the image from your computer to upload.  Once chosen, click the UPLOAD button to the right.  Do this to add as many images as you like.<br/>
For best results, keep you images within the following parameters:
<ul><li><em>Dimensions: </em>800 x 500px works best.  However, images are scaled and cropped to best fit the site in the 800x500 dimension.  So if your image is a scale of 800x500, (700x400, 600x300, 500x200, the same for larger is true 1000x700, 1100x800),  there is no need to crop it for size.</li>
<li><em>File size: </em> Images below 3MB are preferred.</li>
<li><em>File types:</em> png, gif, jpg, jpeg are the only images available.</li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>.  Copy and past the URL of the YouTube video you'd like to display.</p>
<p><strong>Category</strong>.  Select which category your blog post will display in.</p>
<p><strong>Body</strong>. This is where you can type in your stories or any other type of written text.  Although it does have a WYSIWYG interface, (for bolding, formatting text, etc), it is recommended to use formatting sparingly.  The website has been designed to look and perform a certain way.  Unexpected formatting may have unexpected results.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Summary</strong>.  This is the link next to the Body label.  If you click on the edit summary link, you will be presented with a small text area where you can type in a brief description of the story.  This text will appear under the main title, in the black bar that spans across the top of the blog post.  This summary should be kept to one sentence if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Blog Tags</strong>.  Tags are ways you can categorize stories into more specific groups.  For example, any blog post written that is about christmas items, can have the Tag, "Christmas". If a user then wants to see posts only about "Christmas", they can click the christmas tag, and they will be presented with all the posts that have the tag, "christmas" no matter what category the blog post is actually in.  You can do the same for dog breeds, cat breeds, or any other category you can think of.</p>
<p>Currently, the Blog tags field is an auto complete field.  That means that if the tag exists, it will pop up when you start typing.  If the Tag does not exist, simply type it in and save and it will get added to the Tag list automatically.  You can add multiple tags by separating each tag with a comma (,).</p>
<p><strong>Priority</strong>.  This can be any number from 1-10, with 1 being the highest priority and 10 the lowest.  If you want your blog post to appear at the top of the list of stories that is seen on the blog front page, then make it a priority 1.  If two stories both have a #1 priority, then the story that was posted most recently will win.  By default, all blog posts are set to the lowest priority.</p>
<p><strong>Preview button</strong>. Displays a preview of everything you've entered.</p>
<p><strong>Save button</strong>.  Saves, publishes, and posts your blog post to the correct category within the website.</p>
