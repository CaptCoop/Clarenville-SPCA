<h2>Add a new <span>Animal Profile</span></h2>
<p>To add a profile, fill out the following fields:</p>
<p>Fields marked with a green asterisk (<span>*</span>) are mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> This is the animals name</p>
<p><strong>Intake Date:</strong> This is the date the animal came into the shelter.  By default, it will pick todays date.</p>
<p>If you need to go back in time, simply click in the date field to get the calendar popup.  You can choose dates three years into the future or past.</p>
<p>The <strong>Show End Date</strong> checkbox, shows another date field that should be filled in once the animal has left the shelter.  This field gets filled in when <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/animal_requests_close">Closing a File</a>, and will be covered there.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Family</strong> refers to the type of animal you're entering.  Cat, Dog or even Rabbit.  You can
add in as many animal types as you like.  This information is also used elsewhere within the site by other searches
and forms.  So it is good to keep it filled with any type of animal that you may have in the shelter.  Not just the animals
that you have on hand at any one time.  If you will only deal with cats and dogs, then you will never need this feature.
If you need to add in other animal types, (chickens, mice, snakes, gerbils, etc), see the help file <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/taxonomy">Animal Family Types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sex</strong> If the animal is a girl or a boy.</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>.  The actual or estimated age of the animal.  0 is under a year old, (puppy or kitten).  If the actual age is not known, then as close as possible will do.  This field is searched by other features within the site and must therefore be a single number, rather than a range of numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Hair Type</strong>.  This is the hair types that are found in cats and dogs.  To tell the types apart, remember that cats have <em>hair</em> while dogs have <em>coats</em>.  Short Hair, Long Hair and Hairless are for cats.  Dogs on the other hand, have Smooth Coats like beagles or yellow or black labs.  Wavy Coats like that found on poodles, Wire Hair or Broken Coats can be long or short hair and can be found on most terriers or mixed breads.  Of course, dogs can also have Long Coats as found in Newfoundland dogs, Irish Setters or Sheepdogs. This field is also used as a search field by other features within the site.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Size</strong>.  The size of the animal.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>.  The availability or unavailability of the animal.  The default is for an animal to always be available for adoption.
<ul><li>Animals <em>Available for adoption</em> will display in the "Available Pets" search, and can be found easily within the site.</li>
<li>Animals marked as <em>Adopted</em> will display in the <em>recently adopted</em> sections and searches.</li>
<li>Animals marked as <em>Euthanized</em> will not be actively displayed on the site but their profile can still be accessed through searches and is fully available to anyone online.  Unpublish profiles you do not wish the general public to see.</li>
<li>Animals marked as <em>Fostered</em> will display in the <em>recently fostered</em> and <em>available for adoption</em> sections and searches.</li>
<li>Animals marked as <em>Gone to rescue group</em> will not be actively displayed on the site but their profile can still be accessed through searches and is fully available to anyone online.  Unpublish profiles you do not wish the general public to see.</li>
<li>Animals marked as <em>Returned to owner</em> will not be actively displayed on the site but their profile can still be accessed through searches and is fully available to anyone online.  Unpublish profiles you do not wish the general public to see.</li>

</ul></p>
<p><strong>Foster Program</strong> check box.  If you want to make this animal available for fostering, (and display a "Foster Me" button on the cover page), then check this box.  Learn more about the <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/foster_program">Foster Program</a></p>
<p><strong>Pet of the Week</strong> check box.  This will display the profile in the "Pet of the Week" searches and displays.</p>
<p><strong>New Leash on Life</strong> check box.  This will display in the profile area, that this animal is enrolled in the "New Leash on Life" program.</p>
<p><strong>Image</strong>.  Click the "choose file" button to select the image from your computer to upload.  Once chosen, click the UPLOAD button to the right.  Do this to add as many images as you like.<br/>
For best results, keep you images within the following parameters:
<ul><li><em>Dimensions: </em>800 x 500px works best.  However, images are scaled and cropped to best fit the site in the 800x500 dimension.  So if your image is a scale of 800x500, (700x400, 600x300, 500x200, the same for larger is true 1000x700, 1100x800),  there is no need to crop it for size.</li>
<li><em>File size: </em> Images below 3MB are preferred.</li>
<li><em>File types:</em> png, gif, jpg, jpeg are the only images available.</li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Body</strong>. This is where you can type in your description, stories or any other type of written text.  Although it does have a WYSIWYG interface, (for bolding, formatting text, etc), it is recommended to use formatting sparingly.  The website has been designed to look and perform a certain way.  Unexpected formatting may have unexpected results.</p>
<h3>Health <span>Information</span></h3>
<p>The health information is broken down into three sections.  The main information that is displayed by default, the <em>Vaccinations</em> section and the <em>COMBO Testing</em> section.  We'll deal with the default section first.</p>
<p><strong>Microchip Number</strong>.  If the animal has a microchip number, enter it here.</p>
<p><strong>Veterinarian Office</strong>.  If the animal has no vet then choose nothing, as the default is for None Assigned.  If the animal has a vet, choose the clinic name from the dropdown list.  If you do not see the clinic name, you can add in more by following the tutorial at <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/taxonomy">Adding More Veterinarian Offices</a></p>
<p><strong>Veterinarian Visit Date</strong>.  Click in the Date filed to bring up the popup calendar.  Choose the date the animal visited the vet and the date field auto populates.  You do not need to click the "Add Another Item" button unless you're adding more than on visit date.</p>
<p><strong>Vet Results & Notes</strong>.  Enter in any notes or important items that came out of the visit.  Don't forget to mark the date visited above.</p>
<p><strong>Spayed/Neutered</strong>. If the animal was spayed or neutered or not.  If no, no date is required.  If yes, enter the Spayed/Neutered Date below.</p>
<p><strong>Spayed/Neutered Date</strong>. By clicking in the Spayed/Neutered Date field, the popup calendar will appear.  Enter the date the animal was spayed/neutered.  If the date is not known, enter a best guess.  This field is also used as a search field by other features within the site.</p>
<p><strong>Dewormed Date</strong>.  If the animal was dewormed, click in the Date field and choose a date from the popup calendar.  If the animal was dewormed more than once, then click the ADD ANOTHER ITEM button and enter a second date.</p>
<h3>Vaccinations</h3>
<p>This section only accepts dates that each vaccination was received.  For all the following fields, click in the Date field to bring up the popup calendar.  There is no limit to how many dates you can add.</p>
