<h2>Administer an Animal <span>Request</span></h2>
<p>Any new applications that arrive into the system will be automatically marked with a application status of "Waiting".  All waiting applications are new applications that have not been administered yet.</p>
<p>Once you access an application, you should change the application status to "In Review" and save.  This will let you know that this application has been accessed and is being looked at by someone.</p>
<p>Click on the name of each possible match and compare the animal details to those that were requested.</p>
<p>If a suitable match has been found, simply click on the users email address to open your email program.  You can then send that user a message alerting them of the possible match you had discovered.</p>
<p>Don't forget to make detailed notes on what you did.  When the user was contacted, what animal(s) were possible matches, etc.</p>
<p>Change the Application Status to "Contacted" and save.</p>
