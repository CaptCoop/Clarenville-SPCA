<h2>Add a New <span>Veterinarian</span> Office</h2>

<p><strong>Name</strong>.  This is the name of the Veterinarian Office</p>
<p><strong>Image</strong>.  Click the "choose file" button to select the image from your computer to upload.  Once chosen, click the UPLOAD button to the right.  Do this to add as many images as you like.<br/>
For best results, keep you images within the following parameters:
<ul><li><em>Dimensions: </em>800 x 500px works best.  However, images are scaled and cropped to best fit the site in the 800x500 dimension.  So if your image is a scale of 800x500, (700x400, 600x300, 500x200, the same for larger is true 1000x700, 1100x800),  there is no need to crop it for size.</li>
<li><em>File size: </em> Images below 3MB are preferred.</li>
<li><em>File types:</em> png, gif, jpg, jpeg are the only images available.</li></ul></p>
<p><strong>Body</strong>. Enter any of the Veterinarian details, contact numbers, address, notes or anything else you like, here.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>.  Check off all the doctors that work here.  If the doctor does not exist, you can add more doctors by following help file <a href="topic:animal_adoptions/add_doctor">Add Doctor</a>. </p>
