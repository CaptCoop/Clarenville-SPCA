<h2>Add Content</h2>
<p>This link will present you with a list of "Content Types" that you can add to the website.  You can also hover over this link to display a fly-out menu of the same "Content Types" that you can add to the website.</p>
<p>As before, if you do not see the Content Type in your sub-menu that is being discussed, you probably don't have the required privileges for that item.</p>
<p>Only Published content will display to everyone.</p>
