<h2>Close an Adoption <span>Application</span></h2>
<p>When an animal has been adopted there are several steps required to close the file.
<ul><li>Access the animal profile by either clicking on the animals name (if in the adoption review mode) or through the "Content" link on your management navigation menu.</li>
<li>Click the edit link to bring up the animal profile details.</li>
<li>Under the "Intake Date" section, click the Show End Date checkbox and fill in the date that the animal left the shelter</li>
<li>Change the Animal Status to the appropriate category, (adopted, fostered, etc)</li>
<li>Remove the animal from the Foster Program or Pet of the Week if it has been checked.</li>
<li>Save the file</li></ul></p>
<p>This will remove the animal from any areas of the site where users can apply to adopt or foster the animal.  It will also remove all action buttons from the file. The animal profile will still be available on the site if it is accessed or searched for.</p>
